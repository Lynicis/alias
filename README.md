## Terminal Aliases

### How to use?
You can copy want alias and use this on terminal.
or You can clone this repo but don't forget global variable and features on your ```xrc``` file.

if you are using oh-my-zsh.

```bash
# with vim
-> vi ~/.zshrc
# with gedit or etc
-> gedit ~/.zshrc

# and use "source" command
-> source ~/.zshrc
```

if you are using default bash. Use ```~/.bashrc``` instead of ```~/.zshrc```

```bash
# General
alias godmode="sudo su"
alias offG="exit"
alias saupd="sudo apt update"
alias saupg="sudo apt upgrade="
alias rf="sudo rm -r"

# Project
alias babe="yarn add"
alias upBabe="yarn run start"
alias buildBabe="yarn run build"
alias devBabe="yarn run dev"
```

### Why is there no ```l``` or etc?
Because default come this on Ubuntu. But you can add like up there.
