```bash

-> vi ~/.zshrc
# with gedit or etc
-> gedit ~/.zshrc

# and use "source" command
-> source ~/.zshrc
```

if you are using default bash. Use ```~/.bashrc``` instead of ```~/.zshrc```

```bash
alias godmode="sudo su"
alias offG="exit"
alias saupd="sudo apt update"
alias saupg="sudo apt upgrade="
alias rf="sudo rm -r"
